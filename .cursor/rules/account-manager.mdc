Rules for Account Manager

- This is the most complex one with all kind of variations.
- First of all it has 2 cases

  - For Americans

    - There is no look back.
    - We just plus minus all the cash collected for the month apply americanCommissionRate for that user and generate payout for that month
    - Also if he is the deal owner we take 2% of the cash collection and generate payout for the current month also

  - For non americans

    - This involves a look back
    - We go row by row for cash collection
    - We take a cash collection row. lookback when was it invoiced.
    - Total that specific month invoiced and determine what tier level to use
      a. if that month invoice is between 0 - tier1Threshold we use tier1CommissionRate. generate a payout of the current month

      b. if the month invoice is between tier1Threshold+1 - tier2Threshold we do point a + use tier2CommissionRate generate a payout for the next month

      c. if the month invoice is greater tier2Threshold+1 we do point a, point b + use tier3CommissionRate and generate a payout for next month
